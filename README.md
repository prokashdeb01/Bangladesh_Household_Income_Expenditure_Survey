# Bangladesh_Household_Income_Expenditure_Survey
This repository contains R codes for compiling dataset from Bangladesh Household Income Expenditure Survey from 2000 to 2016. I only compiled data related to fish consumption and expenditure. However, it can be used for any food and non-food products as well by just changing the proudct id numbers.
